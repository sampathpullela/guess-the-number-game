 # Guess the Number Game

This project is a simple "Guess the Number" game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the correct number. The application provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and congratulates the player on a correct guess.
